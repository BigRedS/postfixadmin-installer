postfixadmin-installer
======================

Script to automate the installation and configuration of a postfixadmin
system on a debian-alike OS (it uses apt-get).

You will need a working Postfix and MySQL server (and ideally knowledge of
the root password for the latter), and LWP::Simple (which is libwww-perl in
dpkg). 

Installation
------------

Just download and run:

	# wget https://raw.github.com/BigRedS/postfixadmin-installer/master/postfixadmin-installer --no-check-certificate
	# perl ./postfixadmin-installer

You will be prompted for MySQL credentials if the debian-sys-maint ones can't be 
found or are found to not work.
